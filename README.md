# Inconsistency

# 📊 Incremental Detection of Text Inconsistencies in Big Data

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and correcting text inconsistencies in large-scale datasets using **Hadoop** for distributed storage and **Apache Spark** for real-time incremental processing. The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to identify inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, contradictory statements, formatting errors, and data anomalies. The project also includes a user-friendly dashboard for real-time visualization of detected inconsistencies.
